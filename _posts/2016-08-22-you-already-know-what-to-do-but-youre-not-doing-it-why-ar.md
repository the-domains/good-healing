  You already know what to do. But you’re not doing it. WHY aren’t you doing it?
  Chances are, you’re already successful in your own right, and you’ve been
  focusing on other things, and that’s part of the reason why you’re not doing
  what you know you could be doing - it simply hasn’t been in your focus. And
  you’re here because you know that now is the time to find a brilliant someone
  to hold you accountable for taking your life to the next level and keep that
  thing in your center focus, whether that thing is your relationship; your
  career; your health; the book you’ve been meaning to write or some other thing
  that’s been whispering in your heart or nudging you in your dreams. And now,
  you’ve landed here. And you’re right on time. Welcome to the next chapter of
  your life.
